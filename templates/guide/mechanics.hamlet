<h2 #skills>Skills
<p>
  Every character has their own skills, which are listed in the <a href=@{CharactersR}>character guide</a>. Entries are formatted as such:

<h3 #duration>
  Duration
<p>
  While active, skills that last for multiple turns are indicated by an icon above their user, along with their remaining duration. Status effects and traps that are applied every turn by a skill have their duration represented by â€¢ instead of 1, to indicate that they will be refreshed next turn.
<ul><dl>
  <li #instant>

      Action skills are actions carried out by their user for multiple turns. If the user is stunned while performing an action skill, the action will temporarily cease its effects. It will resume once the user is no longer stunned. If the number of turns is not specified, the skill lasts indefinitely.
  <li #control>
    <dt>
      Control
    <dd>
      Control skills are "grab"-like skills that last for multiple turns and require a continual connection between the user and the target. The skill takes effect every turn for some number of turns. The skill is canceled if the user is stunned or their target becomes untargetable due to invulnerability, death, etc. If the number of turns is not specified, the skill lasts until canceled.
  <li #ongoing>
    <dt>
      Ongoing

    <dt>
      Health
    <dd>

  <li #damage>
    <dt>
      Damage
    <dd>
     Decreases the target's health by an amount. The amount is increased by the user's strengthening effects and the target's vulnerability effects, and decreased by the user's weakening effects and the target's damage reduction effects.

      Destructible Defense
    <dd>
      Appends to the target's health bar and takes damage instead of the target. Temporary destructible defense disappears after some number of turns, but permanent destructible defense remains until it is fully destroyed. Losing destructible defense does not count as taking damage.

<h2 #status-effects>
  Status Effects
<p>
  Status effects are self-descriptive, so there are only a few worth pointing out specifically.
<ul>
  <li #afflict>
    <strong>
      "Receives &lt;X&gt; affliction damage every turn."
    Affliction damage over time is affected by its source's strengthening status effects and its subject's vulnerability status effects. Affliction damage over time is always classified as <i>Bane</i>, meaning it can be cured by healers.
  <li #endure>
    <strong>
      "Prevents health from dropping below 1."
    The subject cannot die, except by killing themselves with skills such as ^{Link.skill "Deidara" Shippuden "C0: Ultimate Art"}.
  <li #expose>
    <strong>
      "Unable to reduce damage or become invulnerable."
    Damage to the subject ignores their damage reduction status effects, and they cannot apply invulnerability affects to themselves. Does not negate invulnerability that the subject already had.
  <li #invulnerable>
    <strong>
      "Invulnerable to &lt;X&gt; skills."
    Invulnerability prevents its subject from being affected by certain types of skills. By default, invulnerability only affects skills from enemies, but some skills specify that they make the subject invulnerable to allies.
    <i>
      Bypassing
    skills ignore invulnerability.
  <li #reflect>
    <strong>
      "Reflects &ltX&gt;."
    By default, if an enemy uses a skill on the subject, the skill will affect the enemy instead of the subject. Some reflects cause skills to affect a specific target rather than their user.
    <i>
      Unreflectable
    skills ignore reflects. If a status effect specifies that it only reflects the first skill, it does not count
    <i>
      Unreflectable
    skills.
  <li #snare>
    <strong>
      "Increases cooldowns by &ltX&gt;."
    If the subject uses a skill, that skill will go on cooldown for X additional turns. Does not increase the remaining duration of skills that are already on cooldown.
